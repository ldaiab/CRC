This provides functions for calculating a model-free, rank-based correlation coefficient (CRC) suitable for right-censored data and its application in independence testing.  It's designed to be a computationally efficient tool for researchers and practitioners working with survival data.

## Features

*   Calculates the CRC for right-censored data.
*   Implements permutation tests for independence testing.
*   Offers both fixed and dynamic permutation strategies for p-value estimation.
